                    <h2>What is credit?</h2>
                    <p class="lead">To start, we must first understand what credit is. Since few people are rich enough
                        to pay for things in one go, many people rely on borrowing money to pay for things they wish to
                        acquire. Lenders, service providers, banks, and merchants grant you money or services with the
                        expectation that you will pay them back. Your history is summarized in a file called your credit
                        history. So the three big credit bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax then give borrowers
                        a credit score. This score means how trustworthy you are to creditors and companies in terms of
                        your ability to pay them back. This is a 3-digit score with the lowest possible number being 300
                        and the highest being 850. Creditors or anyone who is in a position to lend money will use this
                        number to determine if you are likely to pay them back on time or if they might not see that
                        money again. </p>

                            If you have a credit card account or a loan that is in good standing and you want to close
                            it or pay it off all at once, it will lower your score by a few points. Since these accounts
                            are used to calculate your credit utilization rate, closing them can lower your score by a
                            few points.
                            This is temporary, but it is a good idea to time it right in case you are looking for a job,
                            an apartment, or trying to make a big purchase. You could wait a bit before closing the
                            account or paying off that loan completely. This is especially important if your score is
                            borderline two different levels.

                            Only paying off the minimum balance can be risky because you are paying interest on the
                            remaining balance each month. Debt can easily build up. <div></div>
                            Maxing out your credit cards, even if you can pay them off, will lower your score. Your
                            credit utilization ratio will show that you are in more debt than normal, and it will put
                            the lenders on edge. Learn more about credit cards and choose the right one for you here.

                            Applying for a credit card, or loan will count as a hard inquiry on your report. It will go down by a point every time. If you get denied initially and keep trying; or if you open too many credit lines at once, your score will go down. The lender will think you are taking on a lot of debt at once. Which will make them hesitate to approve anymore.
